#The Ricker Model is a discrete model of population growth often used in fisheries management.
#Note: here, "discrete" means that change only happens at each time step, as opposed to a continuous model.
#The formula for the Ricker Model is: x, at time t+1 = x*e^(r*(1-(x/K))), where the variables are as defined below.

#This R script creates a function, ricker_model(), that takes 4 input variables:
#x = starting population size
#r = rate of population growth
#k = carrying capacity
#tmax = number of time steps

#The function returns a vector containing the population size at each time step.
#The function also plots population size over time with a line graph.

  vec <- rep(NA, tmax+1)
  vec[1] <- x

    vec[i+1] <- x
